Statistical analysis of data related to the impact of glasses prescription changes on measures of balance. A spreadsheet is provided (66 patients - 34 who had never worn glasses, 32 who started the process wearing their old prescription glasses) with the following data:

Gender: male/female
Age
Glasses_FVE:  patient wore classes at time of Functional Visual Evaluation (Y/N)
Months since concussion
Pre-measures of proprioception (percentile) - kinesthesia (awareness of limb movements) and joint position sense
Pre-measures of visual (percentile) - allows us to sense the environment and move through space
Pre-measures of vestibular (percentile) - senses motion,equilibrium and spatial awareness.
Number of weeks with glasses
Post-measures of proprioception (percentile)
Post-measures of visual (percentile)
Post-measures of vestibular (percentile)

I'll need range of improvement, average improvement and statistical significance calculations. I'll also need a comparison of how those who wore glasses prior to injury improved when compared to those who did not wear glasses prior to injury.
