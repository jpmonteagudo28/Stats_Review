Statistical analysis of data related to the impact of glasses prescription changes on measures of balance. A spreadsheet is provided (66 patients - 34 who had never worn glasses, 32 who started the process wearing their old prescription glasses) with the following data:

Gender: male/female
Age

Glasses_FVE:  patient wore classes at time of Functional Visual Evaluation (Y/N)

Months since concussion

Pre-measures of proprioception (percentile) - kinesthesia - Romberg test (measured in seconds able to stand w. eyes closed) (awareness of limb movements) and joint position sense (https://www.physio-pedia.com/Romberg_Test)

Pre-measures of visual (percentile) - allows us to sense the environment and move through space

Pre-measures of vestibular (percentile) - senses motion,equilibrium and spatial awareness. (https://www.physio-pedia.com/Objective_Vestibular_Assessment?utm_source=physiopedia&utm_medium=related_articles&utm_campaign=ongoing_internal)

Number of weeks with therapeutic glasses

Post-measures of proprioception (percentile)

Post-measures of visual (percentile)

Post-measures of vestibular (percentile)

I'll need range of improvement, average improvement and statistical significance calculations. I'll also need a comparison of how those who wore glasses prior to injury improved when compared to those who did not wear glasses prior to injury.
