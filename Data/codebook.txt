Statistical analysis of data related to the impact of glasses prescription changes on measures of balance. A spreadsheet is provided (66 patients - 34 who had never worn glasses, 32 who started the process wearing their old prescription glasses) with the following data:

Age
Months since concussion
Pre-measures of proprioception (percentile)
Pre-measures of visual (percentile)
Pre-measures of vestibular (percentile)
Number of weeks with glasses
Post-measures of proprioception (percentile)
Post-measures of visual (percentile)
Post-measures of vestibular (percentile)

I'll need range of improvement, average improvement and statistical significance calculations. I'll also need a comparison of how those who wore glasses prior to injury improved when compared to those who did not wear glasses prior to injury.
